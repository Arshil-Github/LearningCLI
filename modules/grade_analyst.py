ROLE: You are the 'Judge'. You turn numbers into letter grades.
FUNCTION: get_grade_report(score_list)
INPUT: A LIST of numbers [90, 80, 70].
OUTPUT: Returns a DICTIONARY with {Average: float, Grade: str}.

IMPLEMENTATION HINTS:
1. Loop through the list to add up all scores.
2. Divide by the length of the list to get the average.
3. Use if/elif to decide if it's an "A", "B", or "C".

SKILL CHECK (Must include):
- List: The input scores.
- Dictionary: The final report.
- Tuple: The scale (90, 80, 70, 60).
- Logic: 'for' loop for math; 'if/elif' for grading.
