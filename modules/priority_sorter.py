ROLE: You are the 'Secretary'. You tell the student what is most important.
FUNCTION: sort_by_priority(task_list)
INPUT: A List of Task Dictionaries (from Person 1).
OUTPUT: A sorted List of Task Dictionaries.

IMPLEMENTATION HINTS:
1. Look at each task dictionary's "priority" key (1 for low, 3 for high).
2. Create three lists: high, medium, low. 
3. Put tasks in the right list, then join them together.

SKILL CHECK (Must include):
- List: Three separate lists for sorting.
- Dictionary: The task data you are reading.
- Tuple: Priority levels ("High", "Medium", "Low").
- Logic: 'for' loop to check every task; 'if' to categorize.
